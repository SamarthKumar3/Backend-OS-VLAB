            (First-Come, First-Served) is a simple disk scheduling algorithm used in operating systems to control and
            optimize the access of disk storage. This algorithm works on the principle of serving the requests in the
            order they arrive in the disk queue.` , learningObjective: `<ul>
            In this experiment, we will be able to do the following:
            <li>Understand the sequential serving principle of FCFS in disk scheduling.</li>
            <li>Analyse and compute seek times while evaluating FCFS performance.</li>
            <li>Compare FCFS efficiency with alternative disk scheduling algorithms.</li>
            <li>Apply FCFS practically, simulate its behaviour, and assess its real-world relevance in operating
                systems.</li>
            </ul>` ,
            overview: `<ul>
                An overview of this experiment:
