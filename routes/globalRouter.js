It simulates resource allocation for maximum possible resource usage and checks if it's safe to proceed. The algorithm prevents deadlocks by ensuring that resources are only allocated when it's safe to do so. It helps determine a safe sequence of resource allocation to avoid deadlocks.", link: "Bankers-Algorithm" },
